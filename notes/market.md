Are plugins set to be installed correctly?

const uuid = (a) => a ? (a ^ Math.random() * 16 >> a / 4).toString(16) : ([1e7] + -1e3 + -4e3 + -8e3 + -1e11).replace(/[018]/g, uuid);


The plugins need to be worked with, Codiad plugins are no longer supported and that is a problem.

Manual Install of PLugins doesn't actually do anything
There is no search feature

Needs a rating system

Plugin Ideas:
	ToDo plugin: Set a time and a descritption and the toast will pop up to notify you, or even just a rolling list of thigns to do with a project
